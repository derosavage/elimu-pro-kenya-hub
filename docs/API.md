# API reference (base path `/api`, JSON)

Success: `{"success": true, "data": ..., "message"?: ..., "meta"?: {page, per_page, total, pages}}`.
Error: `{"success": false, "message": "...", "errors"?: {field: message}}` with 400/401/403/404/409/422/503.
Send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The role and school always come from the database user, never from the request.
Other schools' record IDs return **404**.

## Auth

## Schools
GET `/schools/public` (public, active schools with admissions open) · GET/PUT `/schools/me` · GET `/schools/overview` (admin, bursar) ·
GET/POST `/schools`, PATCH `/schools/<id>/status` (super admin).

## Admissions
Student: GET/PUT `/admissions/my`, POST `/admissions/my/submit`.
Admin/principal/deputy: GET `/admissions?status=&q=&page=`, GET `/admissions/<id>`, POST `/admissions/<id>/review` (`action`: under_review | changes_required | rejected, `note` required for the last two),
POST `/admissions/<id>/approve` (`class_id`, optional `stream_id`, `admission_number`, `note`) → creates the student.

## Students
Student: GET/PATCH `/students/me` (phone only), `/students/me/dashboard`, `/me/results`, `/me/fees`, `/me/timetable`, `/me/announcements`.
Staff: GET `/students?q=&class_id=&status=&page=`, GET `/students/<id>`, PATCH `/students/<id>` (admin: `class_id, stream_id, status`).

## Academics
GET/POST `/classes`, POST `/classes/<id>/streams`, GET/POST `/subjects`, GET `/terms`, GET `/grading`, GET/POST `/exams`,
POST `/results` (`exam_id, subject_id, entries[{student_id, marks, remark}]`), POST `/timetable`.

## Finance
GET/POST `/fees/structures`, POST `/fees/assign` (`term_id`), GET `/fees/balances`, GET/POST `/payments`,
POST `/payments/mpesa/stk-push` (503 unless configured; untested).

## Announcements
GET `/announcements` (students see only their audience/class), POST `/announcements` (admin).

## Teachers
Admin/principal/deputy: GET/POST `/teachers` (`first_name, last_name, email, password`, optional `phone`, `role` teacher|class_teacher), PATCH `/teachers/<id>` (`is_active`, `role`),
POST `/teachers/<id>/assignments` (`class_id, subject_id`), DELETE `/teachers/<id>/assignments/<assignment_id>`.
Teacher: GET `/teacher/dashboard`, `/teacher/classes`, `/teacher/classes/<class_id>/students` (403 if not assigned), `/teacher/announcements`.
Teachers are also allowed on: GET `/students` and `/students/<id>` (only learners in assigned classes, no fee data), GET/POST `/exams` (assigned classes only),
GET `/results?exam_id=&subject_id=` (mark sheet) and POST `/results` (403 unless assigned to that class **and** subject; every student must be in the exam's class;
marks must be 0..exam max; duplicate students in one submission are rejected; the whole submission is rejected if any entry is invalid).

## Parents
Admin/principal/deputy: GET `/parents` (parent logins with linked children), POST `/students/<id>/parent-account`
(`guardian_id`, `email`, `password`): creates a parent login for one of the student's guardians, or, if `email` already belongs to a parent of the same school,
links the guardian to that account (password not needed) so siblings share a login. 409 if the guardian already has a login or the email belongs to another role/school.
Parent: GET `/parent/dashboard`, `/parent/children/<student_id>` (+ `/results`, `/fees`, `/timetable`), `/parent/announcements` (audiences "all" and "parents", class-targeted notices only for classes of their children).
A parent can reach only children linked through a guardian record; any other student id (including other schools') returns 404. Parents get 403 on every staff, teacher and student endpoint.
